What am I even doing? Never in my entire lifetime would I even of thought I would be back in school, let alone going to school for software engineering. It really blows my mind. But, here I am. Having very little knowledge in what I'm reading half the time haha...Hopefully in the near future I can look back at this moment and realze how far I've came. Because right now, I am out of my comfort zone. 

Ok so, who am I? I'm just a normal person who has always had a dream to do something great..If there's anything I could say that I've done that's remotely close to that spectrum, would be playing music. In 1995, I started playing the guitar and in 1996,  the drums. I haven't stopped playing ever since. I have been very, very fortunate to play in several bands, toured across the US, and play countless shows. It's truely something I am honered to have done. But..that's not why I am writing this blog...It's mainly because of this question. 

"Why did you choose software development?"

Well, I have always been interested in programming ever since high school. They actually offered a class in high school, an introduction to HTML. The class was only half a semester, so it was really a true introduction. Ever since then, I've always been intrigued with web development...but never did anything with it. I never pursued the idea that maybe I could do something like this as a career. 

So out of high school, I went right into the workforce. Any school of any kind wasn't on my radar at that time. I stayed in a "comfort zone" of jobs. Just your everyday, 10 hour shift, warehouse type of jobs. Now don't get me wrong, there is **nothing** wrong with those type of jobs. There just wasn't any challange there for me. I needed a change, but I was too comfortable. 

This year I got laid off at my job. It was a company wide lay-off that no one was expecting. I was at a loss.. However..for the first time in my life, I felt like I had an opportunity to change. To change everything. I knew if I didn't take this opporunity, I might not have a chance like this again! So after alot of research, and talking myself into even thinking about going down this path, I applied to Flatiron. 

Now being done with the second week of lessons, labs, and lectures all I can say is, "What the @%#$?!" What did I get myself into? I recall after one of the awesome lectures (seriously lol), I just put my hands over my face and started laughing. I needed to stop for a second and just reset. So I picked up my guitar and started playing along to some songs. At that moment, I realized something crazy.. I just picked up my guitar and without thinking about it, was playing along like it was nothing. (Please note, I am no Joe Satriani or Steve Vai, so I'm **not** claiming I'm this badass haha.) It took years for me to get where I am when it comes to music. 

But it clicked. It made sense. 

I'm frustrated, confused, etc. because I am not comfortable. I am complely out of my comfort zone. 

And that is awesome.




tl;dr - I got into Software Engineering to change my career path and be a better, well rounded human being.
