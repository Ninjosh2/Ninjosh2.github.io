I never heard about this until recently. It was before I enrolled into Flatiron. Just a little before that. The more I read up 
about this, the more it makes sense about how I can feel sometimes! So what is imposter syndrome? According to our good friends at Harvard, 


*Imposter syndrome can be defined as a collection of feelings of inadequacy that persist despite evident success. 
'Imposters' suffer from chronic self-doubt and a sense of intellectual fraudulence that override any feelings of success 
or external proof of their competence*.

I've always had a hard time taking complements when it comes to pretty much anything. Being a musician, you can 
have strangers coming up to you and giving you praise. Of couse I am grateful, but in the back of my head, I'm thinking 
about that one wrong note I hit at the end of the set. I always think I could of done better. I do feel over the years, when
it comes to playing music, I feel more confident overall.. If I can have fun with it, that's all that should matter! 


So what about when you start something you have never had any experience on? And feel like you hit the ground 
running when you start? Well you could feel like the Mayor of Imposter City! Not having any sort of background in web 
development and jumping into a coding bootcamp is bold. Any type of complements I've gotten when it comes to 
being here has imposter syndrome written all over it... Most of the times I feel like I have no clue. Those feeling can 
bring up feeling like an imposter almost instantly. 

So how would you go about not feeling like an impostor? Dr. Valerie Young has came up with 10 steps to combat impostor syndrome. 

1. **Break the silence.** Shame keeps a lot of people from “fessing up” about their fraudulent feelings. Knowing there’s a name for these feelings and that you are not alone can be tremendously freeing. 

2. **Separate feelings from fact.** There are times you’ll feel stupid. It happens to everyone from time to time. Realize that just because you may feel stupid, doesn’t mean you are.

3. **Recognize when you should feel fraudulent.** If you’re one of the first in your field or work place, it’s only natural you’d sometimes feel like you don’t totally fit in. Instead of taking your self-doubt as a sign of your ineptness, recognize that it might be a normal response to being an outsider. 

4. **Accentuate the positive.** Perfectionism can indicate a healthy drive to excel. The trick is to not obsess over everything being just so. Do a great job when it matters most, without persevering over routine tasks. Forgive yourself when the inevitable mistake happens. 

5. **Develop a new response to failure and mistake making.** Henry Ford once said, “Failure is only the opportunity to begin again more intelligently.” Instead of beating yourself up for being human and blowing the big project, do what professional athletes do and glean the learning value from the mistake and move on. 

6. **Right the rules.** If you’ve been operating under misguided rules like, “I should always know the answer,” or “Never ask for help” start asserting your rights. Recognize that you have just as much right as the next person to be wrong, have an off-day, or ask for assistance. 

7. **Develop a new script.** Your script is that automatic mental tapes that starts playing in situations that trigger your Impostor feelings. When you start a new job or project instead of thinking for example, “Wait till they find out I have no idea what I’m doing,” try thinking, “Everyone who starts something new feels off-base in the beginning. I may not know all the answers but I’m smart enough to find them out.” 

8. **Visualize success.** Do what professional athletes do. Spend time beforehand picturing yourself making a successful presentation or calmly posing your question in class. It sure beats picturing impending disaster and will help with performance-related stress. 

9. **Reward yourself.** Break the cycle of continually seeking °© and then dismissing °© validation outside of yourself by learning to pat yourself on the back.

10. **Fake it ‘til you make it.** Now and then we all have to fly by the seat of our pants. Instead of considering “winging it” as proof of your ineptness, learn to do what many high achievers do and view it as a skill. The point of the worn out phrase, fake it til you make it, still stands: Don’t wait until you feel confident to start putting yourself out there. Courage comes from taking risks. Change your behavior first and allow your confidence to build. 

Learning something new can be frustrating and difficult. I personally am going through these feelings now. I do have this feeling that one day, it can be right. It's just a matter of patience and perseverance for me. As cliché as this sounds, it can and will get better!
