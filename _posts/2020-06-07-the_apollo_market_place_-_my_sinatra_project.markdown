So the great thing about this overall project was being able to visualize how I wanted to see the flow of the site. I started off with the initial idea...What was this project going to be about? I enjoy scrolling on Facebook to see what people are selling when it comes to musical equipment. That inspired me to build out The Apollo Market Place (or The AMP for short). A simple application for users to create an account and start selling their equipment. 

I know I needed a basic flow for users to get to one place to the other. So in quick Avi fashion, I used a program called Gliffy https://www.gliffy.com/ This site is awesome if you haven't used it! It's basically an online whiteboard to help map out your ideas.

Just by doing this, it gave me more inspiration with my project! I loved it!

Overall, besides all of the bugs i had to sort out, this was a great project. It gives me so much more clarity on how the back end works with the front end. That's very exciting! 

I can't stress enough how awesome it is to have helping hands in our community. When it's friends, family, and especially everyone here at Flatiron. I know without a doubt those things are leading me to become a better programmer.
