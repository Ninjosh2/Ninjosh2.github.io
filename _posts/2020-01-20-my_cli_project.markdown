So the course of the last couple weeks has been...how can I put this, an overload (haha)! When I found out what type of project we had to do, I could honestly say, I was'nt ready for it. For someone who has never stepped foot in this field, to have to make a running, working program, sounds out of control. As I planned out my project, I thought, "Yeah I can work on this during the week. No Problem." Well....problem. I would start my project, get frustrated with it, and start over. Either completly over or with a new API idea. So Needless to say, this has been one of the most challenging things I think I've ever done. I went with an API to where you can find local eateries in my area (Ft. Worth, Tx.). Still overall, it was very challenging. One thing that I noticed that was really cool was just being able to use the information from the site for the program. Thats awesome! One example was pulling the location of an eatery to a perticular part of your code.
```
 print location_hash(e.location)
 
 
 def location_hash(location) 
        puts "Location Details : "
        puts ""
        puts "  Address : #{location["address"]}"
        puts ""
        puts "  Locality : #{location["locality"]}"
    end
``` 
When that finally worked, I had this smirk on my face. It was very satisfying when it was all said and done. Extremely challenging and very satisfying. Im starting to see a fore-shadowing here...
